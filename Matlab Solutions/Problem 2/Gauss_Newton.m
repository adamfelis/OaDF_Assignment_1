function [x_n, information] = Gauss_Newton(f, df, d2f, x_0, tolerance, max_amount_of_iterations)
% Gauss-Newton algorithm
%   Input arguments:
%       f - function
%       df - derivative of function calculated as J(x)' * r(x) 
%       d2f - second derivative of function calculated as J(x)' * J(x)
%       x_0 - starting point
%       tolerance - if new solution is in the 'tolerance' neighbourhood of
%           previous solution algorithm will stop main loop execution (the best
%           solution is found)
%       max_amount_of_iterations - maximum amount of executed loops - if
%           reached, algorithm decides to stop execution without solution
%   Output parameters:
%       x_n - final result
%       information - structure with some important facts about algorithm
%           execution
%           information.converged - boolean variable, which indicates whether 
%               algorithm converged or not
%           information.amount_of_iterations - amount of iterations used in
%               the algorithm
%           information.approximations - all aproximations of the result, 
%                collected through loop execution;
