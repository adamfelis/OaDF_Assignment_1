% 2.6: Gauss-Newton algorithm
%   Explain why we can consider minx f(x) to be a least squares problem. Implement
%   a Gauss-Newton algorithm with a line search algorithm of your choice. You should
%   motivate your algorithmic choices and explain the algorithm. Test this algorithm
%   for various starting points. Use the contour plot to demonstrate the convergence
%   sequence for this algorithm. Make tables and plots of the convergence rate. Is the
%   convergence rate as expected.
